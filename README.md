# Lift Tracker

A simple mobile app for iOS and Android to create workout schedules and track your workout sessions.
Made with the Flutter framwork.

## Getting Started

Tap on the "+" button to create a workout schedule. Once created, tap on that schedule to start a workout session
and track your lifts (reps, weight, rpe). View all your past sessions in the history tab. An excercise database
will be added in the future with pre-made excercises and workout schedules.
